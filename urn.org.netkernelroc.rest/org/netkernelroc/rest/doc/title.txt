=NetKernel REST management interface=

This module provides an internal and external management interface for
a NetKernel instance.

This interface can be used by external tools to query about the status
or configuration of NetKernel as well as make changes to NetKernel.

{authornote}
The intention is to provide this interface via internal ROC requests, HTTP REST request as well as other
transports.{/authornote}

Here is what the interface should provide:

* Configuration support. Get/Set individual configuration bits or whole sets at a time.
* Running state. Shutdown, Reboot, Refresh (? what is that?)
* Module management. ?How does this relate to modules.d? Do we manage modules.d through this interface?
* Runtime information. We could have information gathered such as requests/sec, etc. and captured internally and then provided through this interface.
